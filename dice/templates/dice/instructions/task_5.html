<p>The virtual bag contains 30 chips, but its composition is randomly determined. That is, the computer will first randomly choose one of the 31 possible and equally likely mixtures displayed below.  The letters R and B in the table denote the number of red and blue chips, respectively. Note, it must be the case that <b>R+B=30</b> in every possible bag. </p>

<p>Choose first the color you would like to bet on and state then your minimum compensation for your chosen bet.</p>
