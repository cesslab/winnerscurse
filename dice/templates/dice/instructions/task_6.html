<p>The virtual bag contains 30 chips, but its composition was determined beforehand by a research affiliate in the economics department.  The letters R and B denote the number of red and blue chips, respectively, and could be any number between 0 red (and 30 blue chips) to 30 red (and 0 blue) chips.  Note, it must be the case that <b>R+B=30</b>.</p>
<p>One chip will be randomly drawn from the bag. You will receive 150 credits if its color matches your bet, otherwise nothing.</p>
<p>Choose first the color you would like to bet on and state then your minimum compensation for your chosen bet.</p>
