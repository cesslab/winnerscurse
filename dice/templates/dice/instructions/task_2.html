<p>The virtual bag contains 20 chips, but its composition is randomly determined. That is, the computer will first randomly choose one of the 21 possible and equally likely mixtures displayed below.  The letters R and B in the table denote the number of red and blue chips, respectively. Note, it must be the case that <b>R+B=20</b> in every possible bag.</p>
<p>One chip will then be randomly drawn from the bag with the selected mixture. You will receive 100 credits if its color matches your bet, otherwise nothing.</p>
<p>Choose first the color you would like to bet on and state then your minimum compensation for your chosen bet.</p>
